HTML/JS Dashboard Workshop
==========================

PPTX and PDF versions of the slides are here.

For more information about pynetworktables2js, see the documentation at http://pynetworktables2js.readthedocs.io

Demo code
---------

The demo code that was presented is available in the 'demo' directory of this repository. It only contains the HTML/JS dashboard code, and not the necessary robot code to make it work.

If you want RobotPy-based robot code to make it work, see the [encoder-demo](https://github.com/frc2423/encoder-demo) repository.
